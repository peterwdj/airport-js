# Airport Challenge - JavaScript
## Makers Academy Week 5

#### Introduction

This project is a recreation of the week 1 weekend challenge, to create a dummy airport in Ruby. Details of this can be found [here](https://github.com/peterwdj/airport_challenge). The difference is that this would be built in JavaScript, as our second project in the language (after [Fizzbuzz](https://github.com/peterwdj/fizzbuzzJavaScript)).

With almost an additional month of OOP under my belt since first attempting this challenge, I felt much more comfortable mapping out domain models from the [user stories](https://github.com/peterwdj/airport_challenge/blob/master/instructions.md), also making use of CRC cards to this end. Our approach was fully test-driven, using the Jasmine testing framework.


#### Instructions
To run the program, run ```xdg-open jasmine/SpecRunner.html``` to open the test file, and then visit the Chrome Developer Console to run the code.


#### Challenges
One of the biggest challenges with this project was getting used to the differences in mocking between RSpec and Jasmine; it took us a while to work out how to correctly stub a method in Jasmine and return a desired value. Beyond this, the remainder of the task was relatively straightforward, and both my pair and I became comfortable with using JavaScript's syntax and style.
